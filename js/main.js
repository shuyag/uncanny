var database = firebase.database();

/* 
When we start generating data from events, we'll want to work on writing information to the database.
We should only be WRITING information to the database -- no need to retrieve data right now on the application, since we can do that via the console. 
More information on https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write
